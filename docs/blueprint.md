## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A warm, inviting blue (#5DADE2), reminiscent of global skies, inspires confidence in travelers. The overall color scheme should follow a light scheme.
- Background color: Light blue background (#EBF4FA), a desaturated shade of the primary to keep the focus on the content.
- Accent color: A contrasting yellow (#F4D03F), analogous to the blue, is used for highlighting important interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font that ensures clarity and warmth.
- Use clear, simple icons to represent scenarios, progress, and other app functions.  Keep icons monochrome, filled style with rounded corners for friendliness.
- A clean, card-based layout is utilized, keeping options structured but friendly, promoting a seamless user experience.
- Subtle animations for transitions and feedback.  A loading animation of soundwaves should appear while the generative AI compiles its response to the user.
